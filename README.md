Title: Design of Twin Blade Digital Vegetable Cutter

Abstract: Normally, vegetable cutter is equipment which is used to chop the vegetables into many slices and in different shapes which is done manually. Usually, chopping of vegetables is a difficult task for homemakers and the chefs who are involved in cooking as a need or profession. So, to overcome this difficulty an automated device is designed in which it saves the time, man power and cost. Many machines are there for cutting the vegetables but the only difficulty is user need to change the blade manually as and when required. The automated slicer is designed in such a way that the user can choose the type of blade in the user interface, in order to cut the vegetables in their preferred shapes and it is portable. The devices used in this project are Arduino UNO, Stepper motor, Bluetooth(HC-05) and customized mobile application.
